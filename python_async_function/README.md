# Python Async Project

## Introduction
This project explores Python\'s asynchronous programming features, focusing on the async and await syntax and asyncio library functionalities. It covers creating asynchronous functions, running concurrent coroutines, managing asyncio tasks, and using the random module to introduce delays.

## Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand and use async and await syntax in Python.
- Execute an async program with asyncio.
- Run concurrent coroutines and manage their execution.
- Create and handle asyncio tasks effectively.
- Utilize the random module within asynchronous functions.

## Requirements
- All files are scripted on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3.7.
- Every script and module includes proper documentation.
- All files end with a new line.
- Code adheres to pycodestyle (version 2.5.x).
- All functions and coroutines are type-annotated.

## Installation
To set up the project environment:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python_async_project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd python_async_project
   ```

## Usage
Execute each script by running:
```bash
./<script_name>.py
```
For example:
```bash
./0-main.py
```

## Tasks
### Task 0: The Basics of Async
Create an asynchronous coroutine that waits for a random delay and eventually returns it.

### Task 1: Execute Multiple Coroutines
Manage multiple coroutines that wait for random delays and return results concurrently.

### Task 2: Measure the Runtime
Measure and calculate the average runtime of executing multiple asynchronous tasks.

### Task 3: Asyncio Tasks
Implement a function that creates asyncio tasks from asynchronous coroutines.

### Task 4: More Tasks
Modify existing coroutine management logic to use asyncio tasks effectively.
