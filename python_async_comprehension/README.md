# Python - Async Comprehension

## Introduction
This project explores advanced Python asynchronous programming techniques, focusing on asynchronous generators, comprehensions, and the efficient use of async/await constructs. It's designed to enhance understanding of Python's asynchronous capabilities introduced in Python 3.7 and above.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, learners should be able to:
- Write and understand asynchronous generators.
- Utilize asynchronous comprehensions in Python.
- Type-annotate generators and comprehensions effectively.

## Requirements
- **Environment**: All files are tested under Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3.7.
- **Coding Style**: Code should adhere to PEP 8 style (version 2.5.x).
- **Documentation**:
  - Each module should include a comprehensive docstring.
  - Each function and coroutine must include a docstring that explains its purpose.
- **End of Files**: All files must end with a newline.
- **Shebang**: All executable scripts must start with `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- **File Testing**: File lengths will be tested using `wc`.

## Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/holbertonschool-web_back_end.git
cd holbertonschool-web_back_end/python_async_comprehension
```

Ensure you have the correct version of Python installed:
```bash
python3 --version  # This should be Python 3.7 or higher
```
